Click the notes on the left and they will repear in the right. Make sure you dont forget to save a note before doing anthing else.  

  ## Credits
  This app was made almost all possibly by myself. I did need to check in with some of my friends to make sure the delete worked and everything did work out in the end.

 # How was it done?

 ### 1: Here I have made my server and added the needed express properties to make my app work.

 ### 2: I then have to make sure I have a page that contains all of my routes and export them.

 ### 3: Then make a page that contains the api routes needed to connect my front end to the back.
